## Overview

This comprehensive educational platform provides:
- Rigorous yet accessible education on AI alignment
- Hands-on interactive elements with real-time visualizations
- 12 complete modules covering RLHF fundamentals to Constitutional AI
- Multiple learning lenses: mathematical, visual, and operational

## Key Features

- **30+ Interactive D3.js Visualizations**: Adjust parameters in real-time and see how algorithms behave
- **4 Analogy Types**: Game Bot, Writing Student, Math Tutor, and Advanced Concepts to make complex ideas concrete
- **Assessment System**: 60+ quiz questions with detailed explanations to reinforce key concepts
- **Production Quality**: Server-side rendering, performance optimized, type-safe architecture

## The Analogy Toolbox

Complex concepts become intuitive through carefully crafted analogies:

- **🎮 Atari Game Bot**: For core RL concepts like policy as game strategy and rewards as score points
- **✍️ Creative Writing Student**: For preference learning where the reward model acts as an editor's taste
- **🧮 Math Tutor Bot**: For reasoning and verification with verifiable rewards
- **🧠 Advanced Concepts**: For constitutional AI and evaluation frameworks

## Curriculum Highlights

### Phase 1: Core RLHF Loop
