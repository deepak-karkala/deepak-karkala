> ### A Note on This Playbook 
>
> In my 5 years of experience as a Machine Learning Engineer, I've noticed a significant gap between academic tutorials and the realities of production MLOps. Many guides stop at deploying a model in a FastAPI container, leaving aspiring engineers without the strategic frameworks and practical insights needed for building robust, end-to-end systems.> 
>
> These playbooks are an attempt to provide a practitioner's blueprint for production machine learning, GenAI, moving beyond the code to explore the critical decision-making, trade-offs, and challenges involved. 
>
> **Important Disclaimers:**
>
> - **On Authenticity**: The methodologies and frameworks shared here are drawn directly from my professional experience.
> - **On Collaboration**: These posts were created with the assistance of AI for diagram, code and prose generation. The strategic framing, project context, and real-world insights that guide the content are entirely my own.
